 - [ ] Simpler unit tests to verify functions
 - [-] Add arguments for, and store, these configuration variables:
   - [X] Time zone
   - [X] Interval for zeta_grid
   - [ ] Rising jump threshold
   - [ ] Rain storm threshold

 - [ ] When highlighting rain, better highlight when rain is above
   storm threshold; highlighting nonzero values is not very
   useful
 - [ ] Convert to local time in plots (via Matplotlib), and / or
   indicate more clearly that datetimes are UTC

 - [ ] Consider calling "load" instead "create" or "init" or something
 - [ ] Fail / bail if the db file exists
 - [ ] Trim test time series to short intervals
