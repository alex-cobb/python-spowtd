 - [ ] Convert sample data from cm to mm
 - [ ] Simpler unit tests to verify functions
 - [ ] Graphical output
 - [ ] Add flags (is_raining, is_storm, is_jump...) to data model and
   populate
   - These will be useful for plots and reassurance that everything is
     working right
 - [ ] Store thresholds / configuration used (for example, to
   designate storms and interstorms) in database
 - [ ] Add arguments for, and store, these configuration variables:
   - Time zone
   - Interval for zeta_grid
   - Rising jump threshold
   - Rain storm threshold

 - [ ] Consider calling "load" instead "create" or "init" or something
 - [ ] Fail / bail if the db file exists
 - [ ] Add grid_interval_mm to interface
