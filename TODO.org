 - [ ] Load evapotranspiration data
   - The semantics are different than for rainfall
   - The ET data is LDASsa output and this is averaged around the
      timestamp so for the first file of Ekolongouma it is:
     - 2013-01-01 01:00:00,0.035261363
     - which means that the total evapotranspiration from 23:30:00 on
       2012-12-31 to 02:30:00 on 2013-01-01 was 0.035261363 mm
   - The result / implication is that the Congo ET is effectively on a
     different grid and I think it will need to be regridded to match
     precipitation.
   - Also, the effective units are mm per 3 h, so that will need to be
     fixed up as well.
   - Really, this should be done in preprocessing, so in a way the
     correct action with the existing data is to exit with an error
     message for the user.
   - Then, I could write, or ask Sebastian to write, a script to fix
     up ET so that it is acceptable as input.
 - [ ] Add ET to time series plots
   - Decline in recession curve is about 700 mm in 50 days
   - Mean ET for Ekolongouma is 0.172796635297707 mm / h
   - That implies a total water loss of about 207 mm in 50 days
   - ... and a mean Sy of 0.296, which seems quite reasonable
 - [ ] Resolve discrepancy in units between spline and Peatclsm
   transmissivity

 - [ ] Simpler unit tests to verify functions
 - [ ] Trim test time series to short intervals
 - [ ] Don't create an SQLite db if it doesn't exist for commands for
   which this is inappropriate
 - [ ] Implement generation of PEST files for calibration against rise
   and recession intervals
