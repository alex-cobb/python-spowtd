 - [ ] Resolve discrepancy in units between spline and Peatclsm
   transmissivity
 - [ ] Update man page
 - [ ] Simpler unit tests to verify functions
 - [ ] Trim test time series to short intervals
 - [ ] Don't create an SQLite db if it doesn't exist for commands for
   which this is inappropriate
 - [ ] Don't create SQLite db if load fails (create in memory, then
   dump)
 - [ ] Fix regression tests on PEST control files to work around
   floating-point precision issues
   - This is a headache.  We are comparing text files, and the
     floating-point values in the "observation data" section can
     differ across machines.  We could verify that the other sections
     of the files match, and then parse and compare floating-point
     values in this section?
   - Using a %f formating operator (instead of %g) might resolve the
     issue?
 - [ ] Use fixtures to speed up tests that require assembly of rise
   and recession curves
