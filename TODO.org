 - [X] Put staging tables in schema
   - This will allow the generation of troubleshooting plots
 - Downsampling the water table might be the more defensible choice;
   so then I would do everything on the precipitation grid.
   - Maybe there's a way of avoiding regridding entirely; you could
     still match up storms to rising intervals.  But this would be
     new, and it's not "the simplest thing that could possibly work."
 - [ ] Add timezone argument on load;
   - Store in db?
   - Maybe this should be called "create" or "init" or something
     if this always makes something from nothing?
   - Should we fail / bail if the db file exists?
 - [ ] Add pytz to dependencies
   - python3-pytz
 - [ ] Add numpy to dependencies
 - [ ] Convert sample data from cm to mm
 - [ ] Add logging in load.py
 - [ ] Add grid_interval_mm to interface when initing / loading data

 - [X] Sebastian: semantics of datetimes for rainfall intensity
 - [X] Sebastian: ET is given in "mm".  Is this cumulative ET over the
   3-hour interval, or mm / h (or somesuch)?
