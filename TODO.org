 - [X] Add docs on usage of covariance for rise analysis
 - [ ] Add regression test of rise analysis with covariance
 - [ ] Enable use of l1 norm instead of l2 norm when fitting rise
   curves
   - Use Cholesky decomposition of covariance matrix to decorrelate.
   - Then use cvxopt:
     https://cvxopt.org/examples/mlbook/l1.html
   - This module is not actually in the CVXOPT distribution; it is included as
     an example module (which, at least on Fedora, is not really set up like a
     module; there is a test problem that will be executed on import).
 - [ ] Add deltaMu (vertical shift) as a peatclsm parameter
 - [ ] Resolve discrepancy in units between spline and Peatclsm
   transmissivity
 - [ ] Update man page
 - [ ] Simpler unit tests to verify functions
 - [ ] Trim test time series to short intervals
 - [ ] Don't create an SQLite db if it doesn't exist for commands for
   which this is inappropriate
 - [ ] Don't create SQLite db if load fails (create in memory, then
   dump)
 - [ ] Use fixtures to speed up tests that require assembly of rise
   and recession curves
