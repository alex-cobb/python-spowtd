 - [ ] Fail / bail on load if the db file exists
 - [-] Add arguments for, and store, these configuration variables:
   - [X] Time zone
   - [X] Interval for zeta_grid
   - [ ] Rising jump threshold
   - [ ] Rain storm threshold
 - [X] Convert to local time in plots (via Matplotlib), and / or
   indicate more clearly that datetimes are UTC

 - [ ] When highlighting rain, highlight when rain is above storm
   threshold; highlighting nonzero values is not very useful

 - [ ] Simpler unit tests to verify functions
 - [ ] Trim test time series to short intervals
